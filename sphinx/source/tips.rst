Tips and tricks
===============

Minimum code to run stages
--------------------------

Directly/manually running stages can be useful for a variety of reasons, whether for debugging them,
using the same configuration values as from an experiment, or as a basis for exploration in
a jupyter notebook.

The smallest set of components needed to do this is an ``Params`` instance, an
``ArtifactManager``, and a ``Record``:

.. code-block:: python

    # required components
    from curifactory import ArtifactManager, Record
    from params import Params  # a custom dataclass extending cf.ExperimentParameters

    # import whatever stages you need to run
    from stages.data import get_data, clean_data

    # initialize instances of the required components
    params = Params() # create/initialize the params. Note that you could also directly
                      # load and manually call the get_params() of a parameter file
    mngr = ArtifactManager("some_cache_ref_name") # the caching prefix name (normally
                                                  # the experiment name)
    record = Record(mngr, params)

    # run desired stages
    clean_data(get_data(record))

    # get the return from the last run stage (you could also get it from record.state)
    print(record.output)

Note that calling any stage, e.g. ``get_data(record)`` returns the modified record that
was passed in, and since calling a stage always only takes exactly one parameter, (the record
to use) you can directly chain the stages together with ``clean_data(get_data(record))``


Common dataset for multiple different argsets
---------------------------------------------

For some experiments, you may have a single dataset processing procedure that all other parameter sets
share. By default, caching only applies to a single parameter set, so the data would have to be recomputed for
every parameter set, if you defined your entire experiment in one procedure. However, it's possible to write
your experiment to "share" the state of a data processing record with the remainder of your argsets.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(param_sets: List[Params], mngr: ArtifactManager):

        # define the procedures
        common_data_proc = Procedure([get_data, clean_data], mngr) # the resulting state of this procedure
                                                                   # should be the same for all our
                                                                   # parameter sets, so we only want to run
                                                                   # once it
        model_proc = Procedure([train_model, test_model], mngr) # this procedure is where we expect our
                                                                # argsets to differ, so run it per param set

        # run our common procedure once (assuming all of the relevant parameter sets are _actually_ the
        # same, we can just pull from the first one)
        data_record = common_data_proc.run(param_sets[0])

        # run each argset through model procedure
        for param_set in param_sets:
            record = data_record.make_copy(param_set) # duplicate the data record's state but with new param sets
            model_proc.run(param_set, record) # we can manually specify the record to use in a procedure if
                                              # we already have one

The above will result in an experiment graph that looks something like the following, assuming two argsets:

.. figure:: images/common_proc.png
    :align: center

The ``make_copy()`` function on ``Record`` instances creates a new record with a deepcopy of the
``state`` attribute, meaning you can define procedures that only have later stages, and pass them
the copied records.

This can be extended beyond just common datasets - any baseline procedure that will not change state
across different parameter sets in a given experiment can follow this same pattern.


Branching in experiments
------------------------

When running experiments that compare many different approaches, it is likely you'll need to
run different procedures for different parameter sets (as different stages may be necessary, for example in
training an sklearn algorithm versus a model implemented in pytorch.) Since experiment scripts are
arbitrary, you can create parameters intended solely for use in the experiment itself, and simply branch
based on those parameters for each given parameter set:

.. code-block:: python

    def run(param_sets: List[Params], mngr: ArtifactManager):
        proc1 = Procedure([get_data, clean_data, train_sklearn_alg, test_model], mngr)
        proc2 = Procedure([get_data, clean_data, train_pytorch, test_model], mngr)

        for param_set in param_sets:
            # we assume "model_type" is one of the arguments
            if param_set.model_type == "sklearn":
                proc1.run(param_set)
            elif param_set.model_type == "pytorch":
                proc2.run(param_set)

        Procedure([compile_results], mngr).run(None) # an appropriately constructed
                                                     # aggregate stage can still run
                                                     # to compare outputs across multiple
                                                     # procedures.


Using the git commit hash from reports
--------------------------------------

Every time an experiment is run, the experiment store keeps track of the current git commit hash.
If you need to be able to exactly reproduce an experiment, ensure that all code is committed before
the run, and run it with the ``--full-store`` flag (see the :ref:`Full stores` section.)
The output report from your run will contain the git commit hash in the top metadata fields, as well
as the command to reproduce it with the correct cache.

To re-run, checkout that hash in git, and enter the reproduce command given in the report:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit
    experiment some_experiment -p some_params --store-full

    # review the report to get the appropriate run reproduce command and the git commit hash

    # to exactly reproduce:
    git checkout [COMMIT_HASH]
    experiment some_experiment -p some_params --cache data/runs/[RUN_REF_NAME] --dry-cache


Softlinking data directories
----------------------------

If dealing with very large data, in order to not have to mess with cache paths it can sometimes
be useful to softlink the `data/cache` and `data/runs`. If you have one or more starting datasets
that you want your experiments to have access to, you could softlink it to `data/raw`

In order to make these easy to work with, it's recommended to make a shell script or makefile that
runs something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    # link_data_dirs.sh

    ln -s [some_cache_path] ./data/cache
    ln -s [some_runs_folder] ./data/runs
    ln -s [some_datasets_path] ./data/raw
