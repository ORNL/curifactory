    """A class to indicate a stage output as a lazy-cache object - curifactory will
    attempt to keep this out of memory as much as possible, immediately caching and deleting,
    and loading back into memeory only when needed.

    This object is used by "wrapping" a stage output string with the class.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            @stage(inputs=None, outputs=["small_output", Lazy("large_output")], cachers=[PickleCacher]*2)

        resolve (bool): Whether this lazy object should automatically reload the initial
            object when accessed from state. By default this is ``True`` - when a stage specifies
            the string name as an input and this object is requested from the record state, it
            loads and passes in the originally stored object. If set to ``False``, the stage
            input will instead be populated with the lazy object itself, giving the inner stage
            code direct access to the cacher. This is useful if you need to keep objects out of
            memory and just want to refer to the cacher path (e.g. to send this path along

#     curifactory. A ``Ref`` is assumed to be a load-only output, where the stage that creates it is assumed
#     to handle creating and saving the object, and the cacher associated with the ``Ref`` is only in charge
#     of loading it when and if it's needed by later stages.

#     This is useful in cases where a stage is making an external system call to a script that's creating some
#     file, and we only want to directly bring the results of that file into curifactory rather than loading
#     and returning it in the stage, for it to just be re-saved again by the cacher.

class Cacheable:
    """The base caching class, any caching strategy should extend this.

    Args:
        path_override (str): Use a specific path for the cacheable, rather than
            automatically setting it based on name etc.
        name (str): The obj name to use in automatically constructing a path. If
            a cacheable is used in stage header, this is automatically provided as
            the output string name from the stage outputs list.
        subdir (str): An optional string of one or more nested subdirectories to
            prepend to the artifact filepath.  This can be used if you want to
            subdivide cache and run artifacts into logical subsets, e.g. similar to
            https://towardsdatascience.com/the-importance-of-layered-thinking-in-data-engineering-a09f685edc71.
        prefix (str): An optional alternative prefix to the experiment-wide
            prefix (either the experiment name or custom-specified experiment
            prefix). This can be used if you want a cached object to work easier
            across multiple experiments, rather than being experiment specific.
            WARNING: use with caution, cross-experiment caching can mess with
            provenance.
        extension (str): The filetype extension to add at the end of the path.
        record (Record): The current record this cacheable is caching under.
            This can be used to get a copy of the current args instance and is also
            how artifact metadata is collected.
        track (bool): whether to include returned path in a store full copy or not.

    Note:
        It is strongly recommended that any subclasses of Cacheable take ``**kwargs`` in init and pass
        along to ``super()``:

        .. code-block:: python

            class CustomCacher(cf.Cacheable):
                def __init__(self, path_override: str = None, custom_attribute: Any = None, **kwargs):
                    super().__init__(path_override, **kwargs)
                    self.some_custom_attribute = custom_attribute

        This allows consistent handling of paths in the parent ``get_path()`` and ``check()`` functions.

        If no custom attributes are needed, also pass in *args, so path_override can be specified without
        a kwarg:

            .. code-block:: python

                class CustomCacher(cf.Cacheable):

class FileReferenceCacher(Cacheable):
    """Saves a file path or list of file paths generated from a stage as a json file.
    The :code:`check` function will check existence of all file paths.

    This is useful for instances where there may be a large number of files stored or
    generated to disk, as it would be unwieldy to return them all (or infeasible to keep them
    in memory) directly from the stage. When this cacher is checked for pre-existing,
    it tries to load the json file storing the filenames, and then checks for the existence of
    each path in that json file. If all of them exist, it will short-circuit computation.

    Using this cacher does mean the user is in charge of loading/saving the file paths correctly,
    but in some cases that may be desirable.

    This can also be used for storing a reference to a single file outside the normal cache.

    When combined with the :code:`get_dir` call on the record, you can create a cached directory of
    files similarly to a regular cacher and simply keep a reference to them as part of the actual
    cacher process.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @stage(inputs=None, outputs=["many_text_files"], cachers=[FileReferenceCacher])
            def output_text_files(record):
